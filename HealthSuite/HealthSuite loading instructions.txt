Subject: HealthSuite loading instructions...

HealthSuite requires the following system environment:

RedHat Linux (6.2 or 7.1)
  7.1 is highly recommended for it's extra security patches and software,
  but there are two problems.  You will have to manually install an old
  version of Perl.  Oracle 8.1.7 is not supported on RH7.x yet.

Perl 5.005
  This is an old version.  It comes with RH6.2, but newer releases
  of RedHat ship with Perl 5.6 which is not compatible with the pdflib
  library that HealthSuite depends on.  The old version of Perl can be
  downloaded from:
  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/perl5.005_03.tar.gz

Apache 1.3.22 / mod_perl 1.26 / mod_ssl ?
  If you use RH 7.1 you may be able to use the apache, mod_perl, and
  mod_ssl included.  The mod_perl included with RH6.2 is too old and
  never worked to begin with.

  Apache can be downloaded from:  http://httpd.apache.org/
  mod_perl can be downloaded from: http://perl.apache.org/

  You should always use the latest stable build of apache and mod_perl.

  You may also want or need to install mod_ssl.

  mod_ssl is available from http://www.mod_ssl.org/

  I wrote two shell scripts which may be useful (if modified) to assist in
  building a custom apache with mod_perl & mod_ssl:

  neon.physia.com:/usr/src/install_httpd.sh
  neon.physia.com:/usr/src/install_httpd_no_ssl.sh

pdflib 2.01
  Required for the Adobe PDF HCFA1500 rendering.
  Available from: neon.physia.com:/usr/src/pdflib-2.01.tar.gz

Oracle 8i (8.1.7)
  A full oracle client install is required where HealthSuite is to be installed.
  This is necessary to build the Perl Oracle database driver.  When you
  install DBD::Oracle (below) you will need to enter the path where you
  installed the oracle client to.
  The following web site was VERY helpful the first time I installed Oracle
  under Linux:
  http://jordan.fortwayne.com/oracle/

Perl CPAN modules:
  First install the CPAN.pm module itself.  This will facilitate installing the
  other modules.  You can get it from:


http://cpan.valueclick.com/modules/by-category/23_Miscellaneous_Modules/CPAN
/CPAN-1.59.tar.gz

  Once you have the cpan module installed you can execute the 'cpan'
  command from the unix prompt, then type 'install module_name' to
   install all of the following modules:

 Apache::Constants
 Apache::Session
 Apache::Session::NullLocker
 Benchmark
 CGI
 CGI::Carp
 Class::Struct
 DBI
 DBD::Oracle
 Data::Dumper
 Date::Calc
 Date::Manip
 Devel::Symdump
 Dumpvalue
 enum
 Exporter
 File::Basename
 File::Copy
 File::Path
 File::Spec
 HTML::TokeParser
 LWP::Simple
 LWP::UserAgent
 Mail::Sendmail
 Number::Format
 Set::IntSpan
 Set::Scalar
 Storable
 Text::Abbrev
 Text::Template
 Win32::OLE::Const
 Win32::OLE
 XML::DOM
 XML::Generator
 XML::Parser
 XML::Struct
