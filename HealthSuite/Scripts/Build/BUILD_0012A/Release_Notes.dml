			Modified query to improve collection worklist performance.  Also limited the output on the worklist to 250 invoices.  
			Once an invoice is closed, given a future reck date or transferred to a new collector there will be space for a new invoice 
			(if one is available).  Approximate time to display 250 invoices is 25 seconds.
