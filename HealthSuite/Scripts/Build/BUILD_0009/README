BUILD_0009 includes the following enhancements:


B863 - "Proxy errors after db server restart"
Found Oracle bug which caused httpd core dump upon attempting to DESTROY
a dead database connection.  Worked around problem by caching the
dead connection and esatblishing a new connection.

B891 -  "Collection worklist for zero balances"
If a collection item does not have a reck date and the balance on the invoice is
zero the invoice is removed from the collection worklist.  
NOTE : If the user's  min balance values is not > 0 then zero balance invoices WILL stay
on the worklist.
